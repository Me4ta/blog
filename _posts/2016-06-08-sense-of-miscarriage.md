One year ago I wrote [this Russian post](http://me4ta.me/blog/personal/share-what-you-know-with-others/) about our first experience with a miscarriage. I didn't know then it was just the first one. 5 more - after. 

And now I'm pregnant again and it is the longest pregnancy I've ever had (8,5 weeks) and I hope - the successfull one. And again I don't hide it from anyone, don't wait till the 3rd month or till the birth or anything else. Because I know how important it is: talking about your fears.
And recently I found [this English article](http://mosaicscience.com/story/making-sense-miscarriage) describing all my feelings about miscarriages, and it matches my opinion on why it is so important to share your experience with family and friends.
Please, read it and if you want to share - write to me. I'm always open to discuss and support you.
